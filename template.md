Lisp

- History of the language: who/when invented it, which languages influenced it, etc.
 Developed by John McCarthy, creator of artificial intelligence applications, in 1958 to find effective solutions to many problems to be used in artificial intelligence applications. McCarthy published his design in an article titled "Recursive Functions of the Symbolic Expressions and Calculation with the Machine, Part I" at ACM's Communications in 1960. It has shown that it can create a Turing-complete language for algorithms, with an indicator for some simple operators and anonymous functions borrowed from the church.
Steve Russell performed Lisp for the first time. This application was done on an IBM 704 computer using punch cards. Russell read the McCarthy's document and realized that the Lisp eval function could be implemented in the machine code, and consequently a lisp interpreter was formed.
 Two compilation language macros for IBM 704 have become primitive processes for parsing lists: the car (the content of the Address number of the Registration number) and cdr (the content of the Decrease of the Registration number).
In 1962, Tim Hart and Mike Levin implemented the first full Lisp compiler written in Lisp. This application of Hart and Levin was closer to the modern Lisp style.
MIT graduate student Daniel Edwards developed his first garbage collection routines.
 A number of new lisp dialects emerged. During the 1880s and 1990s, efforts were made to combine new lisp dialects in one language. Emerging as a remedy for this extravagant variety, Common Lisp was a version of Lisp in which its derivatives were combined and their disadvantages were eliminated. In 1994, ANSI Common Lisp standard published "ANSI X3.226-1994 Information Technology Programming Language Common Lisp.
Lisp's development slowed somewhat in the 1990s, but it resumed after 2000. Most of the new events focused on Common Lisp, Scheme, Emacs Lisp, Clojure and Racket applications. The content of the new studies also included the development of portable libraries and applications.
